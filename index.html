    <h4><u>Plot:</u></h4>
    <p>
        In 1996, star athlete Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner is being honored at his high school. Halfway through his speech, a group of bullies led by Trevor Olson throws the morbidly obese nerd Robbie Weirdicht (who was taking a shower in the locker room) into the gymnasium and into the middle of the school assembly. Everyone starts laughing except for Joyner and his girlfriend, 
        Maggie Johnson, who are the only ones sympathetic towards Weirdicht; the former even going as far as to quickly cover him with his varsity jacket in a moment of compassion. He thanks Joyner and flees in embarrassment.
20 years later, Joyner is married to Maggie and works as a forensic accountant, but is dissatisfied with his career.
 She suggests they see a therapist to salvage their deteriorating marriage. At work, Joyner receives a friend request on Facebook from Bob Stone, who invites him to meet at a bar. Stone reveals himself to be Weirdicht. Joyner is shocked to see that he has transformed from a morbidly obese nerd into a muscular, fit, confident man with advanced hand-to-hand combat skills.
